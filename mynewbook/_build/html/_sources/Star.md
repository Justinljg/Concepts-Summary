# Star & Snowflake Schema

## Star Schema

Star schema is a mature modeling approach widely adopted by relational data warehouses. It requires modelers to classify their model tables as either dimension or fact.

__Dimension tables__ describe business entitiesâ€”the things you model. Entities can include products, people, places, and concepts including time itself. The most consistent table you'll find in a star schema is a date dimension table. A dimension table contains a key column (or columns) that acts as a unique identifier, and descriptive columns.

__Fact tables__ store observations or events, and can be sales orders, stock balances, exchange rates, temperatures, etc. A fact table contains dimension key columns that relate to dimension tables, and numeric measure columns.

## Normalization 

Normalization is the term used to describe data that's stored in a way that reduces repetitious data. Consider a table of products that has a unique key value column, like the product key, and additional columns describing product characteristics, including product name, category, color, and size. A table is considered normalized when it stores only keys.

## Snowflake Schema

A snowflake dimension is a set of normalized tables for a single business entity. 

When you choose to __mimic a snowflake dimension design__:

- Power BI loads more tables, which is less efficient from storage and performance perspectives. These tables must include columns to support model relationships, and it can result in a larger model size.

- Longer relationship filter propagation chains will need to be traversed, which will likely be less efficient than filters applied to a single table.

- The Fields pane presents more model tables to report authors, which can result in a less intuitive experience, especially when snowflake dimension tables contain just one or two columns.
It's not possible to create a hierarchy that spans the tables.

## Slowly changing dimensions

A slowly changing dimension (SCD) is one that appropriately manages change of dimension members over time. It applies when business entity values change over time, and in an ad hoc manner. A good example of a slowly changing dimension is a customer dimension, specifically its contact detail columns like email address and phone number. 

### Type 1 SCD
A Type 1 SCD always reflects the latest values, and when changes in source data are detected, the dimension table data is overwritten. This design approach is common for columns that store supplementary values, like the email address or phone number of a customer. When a customer email address or phone number changes, the dimension table updates the customer row with the new values. It's as if the customer always had this contact information.

A non-incremental refresh of a Power BI model dimension-type table achieves the result of a Type 1 SCD. It refreshes the table data to ensure the latest values are loaded.

### Type 2 SCD
A Type 2 SCD supports versioning of dimension members. If the source system doesn't store versions, then it's usually the data warehouse load process that detects changes, and appropriately manages the change in a dimension table. In this case, the dimension table must use a surrogate key to provide a unique reference to a version of the dimension member. It also includes columns that define the date range validity of the version (for example, StartDate and EndDate) and possibly a flag column (for example, IsCurrent) to easily filter by current dimension members.


## Role-playing dimensions
A role-playing dimension is a dimension that can filter related facts differently. For example, at Adventure Works, the date dimension table has three relationships to the reseller sales facts. The same dimension table can be used to filter the facts by order date, ship date, or delivery date.

In a Power BI model, this design can be imitated by creating multiple relationships between two tables.

### Limitations

When report authors rely on summarizing columns, rather than defining measures, they can't achieve summarization for the inactive relationships without writing a report-level measure. Report-level measures can only be defined when authoring reports in Power BI Desktop.
With only one active relationship path between date and reseller sales, it's not possible to simultaneously filter reseller sales by different types of dates. For example, you can't produce a visual that plots order date sales by shipped sales.


To overcome these limitations, a common Power BI modeling technique is to create a dimension-type table for each role-playing instance. You typically create the additional dimension tables as calculated tables, using DAX. Using calculated tables, the model can contain a Date table, a Ship Date table and a Delivery Date table, each with a single and active relationship to their respective reseller sales table columns.
