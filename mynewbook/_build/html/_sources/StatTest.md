# Statistical Tests


__A/B testing__, also known as split testing, is a statistical method used in experimental design to compare two versions of a variable, typically referred to as A and B. It is commonly used in marketing, product development, and user experience design to determine which version of a product or service performs better in terms of achieving a specific outcome, such as click-through rate, conversion rate, or user engagement.

__In A/B testing:__

Participants or users are randomly divided into two groups: Group A, which is exposed to the original version (control), and Group B, which is exposed to the modified version (treatment).
The performance of both versions is measured and compared based on predefined metrics.
Statistical analysis is then performed to determine whether the differences in performance between the two groups are statistically significant.
A/B testing is fundamentally different from z-tests and t-tests, which are statistical hypothesis tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data.

__Z-test:__

A z-test is used when the population variance is known and the sample size is large (typically n > 30).
It compares a sample mean to a known population mean and assesses whether there is a significant difference between them.
Z-tests are commonly used for hypothesis testing when dealing with normally distributed data.

__T-test:__

A t-test is used when the population variance is unknown or the sample size is small (typically n < 30).
It compares the means of two samples and determines whether there is a significant difference between them.
T-tests are commonly used for hypothesis testing when dealing with small sample sizes or when the population variance is unknown.



__Hypothesis Testing:__

- Define the null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1). Typically, the null hypothesis assumes that there is no significant difference between the control and treatment groups, while the alternative hypothesis assumes that there is a significant difference.

- Choose an appropriate statistical test based on the data and assumptions. For example, if you're comparing means, you might use a t-test.

- Perform Statistical Test: Use Python libraries such as scipy.stats or statsmodels to perform the chosen statistical test. Pass in the data from both groups and obtain the test statistic and p-value.

- Interpret Results: Analyze the results of the statistical test. If the p-value is less than a chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the groups.

```

import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Extract data from the DataFrame
control_data = df['control_metric']
treatment_data = df['treatment_metric']

# Perform two-sample t-test
t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(control_data, treatment_data)

# Output the results
print("T-statistic:", t_statistic)
print("P-value:", p_value)

# Interpret the results
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("Reject null hypothesis. There is a significant difference between the groups.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject null hypothesis. There is no significant difference between the groups.")

```
